# Text-Editor
a simple text editor that has similar functions of the Windows notepad.

## Features
1. open
2. save
3. find
4. replace

## Known bugs
1. ask to confirm on exit even no edits were made
2. The "find" feature not functioning in some occasions 
(Ex. If a keyword that is not found in the file, it will display as the "reached end of document" ranther than "_keyword_ not found")

## Future improvments
1. Increase the efficiency of opening a large file - read in the file as a chunk instead of one line at a time.
2. Better overall user experience
